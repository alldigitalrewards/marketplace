                <strong>We gather information from members and visitors primarily through the following ways:</strong>

                <strong>Member Profiles, Surveys, and Other Online Forms</strong>
                <br/>
                When you create your online profile as a member, we collect your basic demographic information, your travel interests and your travel preferences. From
                this information we create a profile that helps us identify the type of experience that is most relevant to you. With this information, we can customize
                our services and personalize your experience to suit your needs and preferences. At the initial member profile screen, we ask for a member ID, password,
                e-mail address, demographic information, and your key travel preferences. Occasionally, we may also collect additional personal information if you choose
                to enter a contest or complete another type of online form. Once you are a member, we will use the information we receive from you to determine what travel
                information is most appropriate for you and what information you may find most relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Contact, Booking, Reservation Request, &amp; Feedback Forms</strong>
                <br/>
                Some personal information like member name, hometown, country and other information you choose to submit will be shared with those parties, such as travel
                suppliers, to ensure proper fulfillment when you disclose it to us on the Web-site. This may include, but is not limited to:

                <strong>Cookie Technology</strong>
                <br/>
                We use "cookies" to track and store your preferences in order to personalize our site for you. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser
                and is stored on your computer's hard drive when you visit the Web-site. A cookie assigns a random, unique number to your computer. Cookies allow us to
                recognize members and other users when they come to our Web-site after they initially register. The cookies record "clickstream" information (data
                reporting the URLs or names of the pages on our site that you have visited) and help us estimate our audience size, determine which areas of our Web-site
                are the most popular and serve targeted advertising. Cookies also make your experience easier by saving your preferences and passwords. Our cookies
                customize the Web-site and allow our members and other users to easily update their information. We do not allow anyone else to access your cookie. A
                cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive or read cookie files created by other web sites. You can reject cookies by turning them off in your browser.
                This will, however, prevent you from using our customized services, may limit system performance and may cause certain features of the Web-site to
                malfunction or not work at all. You may also have to repeatedly enter personal information in order to participate in various services or promotions.

                <strong>IP Addresses</strong>
                <br/>
                An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you access the Internet. When you visit a particular page on our Web-site,
                our servers record your IP address. We may record IP addresses in order to facilitate systems administration or to report aggregate information to our
                advertisers (e.g., how many visitors logged on to our Web-site).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section 2. Children's Personal Information.</strong>
                <br/>
                We do not intend to collect personal information from children under 13 years of age, unless this information is collected specifically for fulfilling
                travel reservations. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected individually identifying information from a child under the age of 13, such as full
                name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child, we will promptly
                delete that data from our systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section 3. Use of Personal Information.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>We use your personal information in the following three ways:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To customize our services and personalize your experience
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To serve targeted advertising
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To send you optional e-mail messages
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <strong>Customized Services and Experiences</strong>
                <br/>
                We gather information from members and other users in order to provide them with personalized experiences. Every time you visit our Web-site, we provide
                you with what we believe will be your preferred functionality, the content that will be most relevant for you, and services that will be of the most
                interest to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Targeted Advertising</strong>
                <br/>
                In order to bring you offers that may be of interest to you, and to help finance the cost of making our Web-site available to you, we place advertisements
                on our Web-site. Gathering information from members and other users allows us to target advertisements and sponsorships. We believe this makes information
                on our Web-site more relevant to you and is more productive for our advertisers. For example, if you have indicated that you enjoy fine dining, we can
                target an advertisement to you about a special deal at a fine dining establishment near you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Optional E-mail Messages</strong>
                <br/>
                When you register with our site and indicate you would like to receive e-mails relating to special travel offers and content, occasionally we may send you
                e-mail messages with information and special travel deals related to our services, or third-party products that you may find interesting. If you elect to
                receive such e-mails when you register, you may unsubscribe at any time thereafter. You can unsubscribe by clicking on the unsubscribe submenu in your
                e-mails.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Inform You of New Products and Services</strong>
                <br/>
                From time to time we add products and services and our goal is to keep you informed. We will send you emails concerning new developments, but we encourage
                you to check back often to see what new and happening in the digital rewards world.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section 4. Sharing of Personal Information.</strong>
                <br/>
                As a general rule, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service,
                provide better services, or under circumstances required by law. We will disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that any
                applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of
                another member or user. We will use, or supply to others, aggregated data (independent of any personal identifiers) for research and commercial purposes,
                such as describing our services, members and users to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties.
                <br/>

            <p>

                provided by our Web-site (e.g., a contest, reservation request, booking travel, and/or survey). When you are notified that your personal information will
                be used in a manner that varies from those described in this Privacy Statement, the use of your personal information will be subject to the notification
                for that particular service, such as with sweepstakes, contests or promotions. Please look for privacy statements and terms and conditions that apply to
                the services in which you participate. It is important to note that we do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers and other third-party web
                sites for which we provide advertisements and submenu. If you click through an advertisement or link to and submit your information to an advertiser or to
                another web site, you will be subject to that advertiser's or web site's privacy policies, if any. We do not assume responsibility or liability for such

                <strong>Section 5. Controlling the Use of Your Personal Information.</strong>
                <br/>
                You can reject cookies by disabling them in your browser or you can configure your browser to alert you when cookies are sent. If you register with our
                Web-site and provide us with personal information, you will always have the option at any time to cancel your access or to request that your personal
                information be removed from our systems by contacting us. We will send to you an e-mail message confirming your request. You must acknowledge to us by
                e-mail your receipt of such confirmation. After you respond to our confirmation, we will remove your information from our database. Residual information
                may remain in our archives and/or records. Such information will not be used for commercial purposes, however, we may notify you of major changes to our
                service from time to time. We reserve the right to maintain information about registered members who violate our Terms and Conditions or whose access to
                the Web-site has been denied, in order to detect repeat offenders.

            <p>
                <strong>Section 6. More About Your Privacy</strong>
                <br/>
                You should be aware that personal information you voluntarily disclose online in a public area might be collected and used by others. We do not control the
                actions of visitors, members or users. Your disclosure of personal information in a travel submission, an interactive question and answer, or any other
                publicly-accessible place on our Web-site is done so at your own risk. You should understand that your personal information might be collected and used by
                others to send you advertisements or unsolicited messages or for other purposes. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords
                and should be careful when disclosing your personal information online.
                <br/>
                While we will take appropriate security measures to protect the privacy of your personal information, no protection is foolproof, and transmissions made
                over the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We do not assume any liability for disclosure of data resulting from errors in transmission or made by
                unauthorized third parties.
